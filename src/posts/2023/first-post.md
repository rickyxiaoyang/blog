I'm not a great writer. At times I feel it's hard to convey my thoughts through words. I don't have a strong vocabulary so I often reuse words or resort to a thesaurus for synonyms. I'm not really that public of a person either. I've leaned towards less usage of social media in the recent years. _So why even start a blog?_

> "I can't remember"

I realized that I frequently say it. Whether it's what I ate a few days ago, or an activity I did on a past vacation, or some technical detail of a project I previously completed... I'm realizing that I just don't seem to remember a lot.
