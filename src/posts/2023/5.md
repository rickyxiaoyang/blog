### In the slump

The past few months have felt really sluggish. I haven't felt extremely productive or motivated. I haven't really worked on new side projects. My full-time job has slowed down a bit. Even some of my habits around working out and reading books have waned. But, I got up this morning and it occurred to me. I've been preaching _discipline over motivation_ for years. I'm an ambassador for the idea that we shouldn't rely on that "jolt" to get us up and going. And instead, we should invest in crafting discipline.

So... I'm going to practice what I preach. I want to get myself out of this plateau.

### 70-20-10 rule of learning

The **70-20-10** rule of learning reveals that 70% of our knowledge is built on our day-to-day work, while 20% are from developmental relationships such as managers or tech leads, and the last 10% should come from self-driven learning such as coursework, books, or videos.

Let's apply it.

70% (daily work): Continue to deliver work and improve technically. Set personal deadlines, to-do lists, and daily/weekly goals. Execute, evaluate, fine-tune, and repeat. To make this 70% effective, I need to improve [staying engaged](#staying-engaged).

20% (development relationships): If you read the title of this article, you'll know that I'm participating in a mentorship program! I'm going to be a mentee. Below, I talk more on the [mentorship](#mentorship) program and what I initially want to get out of it.

10% (self-driven):

1. #### Staying engaged

2. #### Asking questions

3. #### Mentorship
